description: Create a PR, enable auto-merge, and open it in the browser
---

Create a pull request using the GitHub CLI, enable auto-merge, and then open it in your web browser.

Steps:
1. Check the current branch. If not on master, you're good. If on master, create and checkout a new branch (e.g. from the changes or a generated name) before proceeding.
2. Check git status and review the changes that will be included in the PR
3. Create a PR using `gh pr create` with a concise body with no fluff. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision. Do not add section titles or formatting - just a brief description of the current change.
4. Finish creation with `gh pr merge --auto --squash && gh pr view --web`.
