Review the diff, and create a git commit for any changes.

Last ten commits:

!`git log --oneline -10`

Analyze these messages to ensure your new commit message follows the project's conventions (e.g. format, tense, capitalization).

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "chore:" prefixes). Use simple, descriptive commit messages without type prefixes.

Then, create the commit with the generated message.
