description: Commit staged changes following project conventions
---

Review the diff, and create a git commit for any changes.

$ARGUMENTS

Last ten commits:

!`git log --oneline -10`

Analyze these messages to ensure your new commit message follows the project's conventions (e.g. format, tense, capitalization).

Use a concise message/body with no fluff. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision. Do not add section titles or formatting - just a brief description of the current change.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "chore:" prefixes). Use simple, descriptive commit messages without type prefixes.

Then, create the commit with the generated message.
