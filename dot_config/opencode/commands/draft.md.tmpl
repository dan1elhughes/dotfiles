description: Create a draft PR and open it in the browser
---

Create a draft pull request using the GitHub CLI and then open it in your web browser.

Steps:
1. Check the current git status and branch
2. Review the changes that will be included in the PR
3. Create a PR using `gh pr create --draft` with a concise body with no fluff. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision. Do not add section titles or formatting - just a brief description of the current change.
4. Open the PR in your browser using `gh pr view --web`
